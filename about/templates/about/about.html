                    <p>I love all kinds of exercise including swimming, lifting weights, running and hiking. Exercise is a major part of my lifestyle. Fitness is my passion. I found my love of fitness at 16 years old and haven't looked back since.</p>

                    <p>I got into fitness at age 16. I was very unfit and had poor eating
                        habits. My father had recently become more active at that time and
                        asked me to join him in going to a bootcamp. I found it very difficult
                        and so, it drove me to always push harder and better myself.</p>

                    <p>My favourite way to exercise would be a push/pull training plan.
                        Push exercises involve working on muscles in the chest, shoulders
                        and triceps. Pull would focus on legs and core. That being said, I
                        really enjoy circuit training because it is challenging and makes me
                        want to better my last attempt.</p>

                    <p>My parents always brought us swimming as kids. I truly believe it is a
                        necessity to obtain this skill from an early age as it could potentially
                        save a life. Although not all my clients are young kids, the courage to
                        try to learn an essential skill at any age is incredible and I find it very
                        rewarding to be able to help them on this journey.</p>

                    <p>Fitness is my passion! The benefits, both physically and mentally,
                        have really changed my life. Being able to help others, with the
                        knowledge I have gained over the years in order to better
                        themselves, is what makes me love doing what I do.</p>

                    <p>Couldn't recommend Iain enough. I did personal training and classes with him. Extremely motivational and always pushed people to do their best. He does fantastic classes and great music. Best personal trainer by far and cannot wait to get back to his classes.</p>

                    <p>I did aqua aerobics twice a week with Iain at Castletroy Park Hotel, all the women loved when Iain was doing the class. His class was great fun, motivational and effective. His wonderful playlists got us moving, old ladies forgot their aches and pains as they exercised to his great music. He cheered everyone up, always had a smile, and his energy and dance moves were a joy to watch.</p>

                    <p>Iain was a very professional, courteous and patient swimming instructor. He had a very kind and gentle approach to teaching, he acknowledged my fear in the water and personalised technigues that helped me relax in the water and become confident in my abilities. Thanks to Iain I am now confident in the water and absolutely love swimming. My confidence and ability has definitely grown to a point where I now really enjoy my time in the gym. I highly recommend Iain as a fitness/swim instructor for somebody wanting to reach their individual goals.</p>

                    <p>Iain is a professional well-prepared trainer with natural charisma, a positive outlook and a growth mindset. The product he delivers to me has responded to any challenge and consistently improved in quality over time. Iain's classes are an excellent fit for me as they are varied and fun. Iain is very professional and is always there early with class equipment set up ready to greet participants as they arrive. He also has good session plans made but is comfortable to adapt if an extra person turns up or if somebody joins in late.</p>
